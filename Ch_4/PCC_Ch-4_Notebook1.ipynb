In this chapter you’ll learn how to loop through an entire list using just a few lines of code regardless of how long the list is. Looping allows you to take the same action, or set of actions, with every item in a list. As a result, you’ll be able to work efficiently with lists of any length, including those with thousands or even millions of items."
