    "\n",
    "The **`input()`** function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter\n",
    "some text. Once Python receives the user’s input, it assigns that input to a\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, the following program asks the user to enter some text,\n",
    "then displays that message back to the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "The input() function takes one argument: the **`prompt`**, or instructions,\n",
    "that we want to display to the user so they know what to do. In this example,\n",
    "when Python runs the first line, the user sees the prompt Tell me something,\n",
    "and I will repeat it back to you: . The program waits while the user enters\n",
    "their response and continues after the user presses enter. The response is\n",
    "assigned to the variable message, then print(message) displays the input back to\n",
    "the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** Sublime Text and many other editors don’t run programs that prompt the user for input.\n",
    "You can use these editors to write programs that prompt for input, but you’ll need to run\n",
    "these programs from a terminal. See “Running Python Programs from a Terminal” on\n",
